## Dotfiles
- location: ~/projects/configs/
- description: The dotfiles projects helps to sync Tools(emacs,nvim, tmux, vscode, claude, joplin, alacritty etc.) configurations between machines. Under `./configs/exec/` there is restorev2 and backupv2 scripts that backup and restore files to actual locations and some config files are symlinked for version control.

## Emacs
If you can see emacs-tools in the /mcp, it means you are running in Claude-Code-ide (https://github.com/manzaltu/claude-code-ide.el) a Emacs integration with Claude Code. You would need to understand how i setup emacs so you will know where to look for configs.

- Config location: `~/projects/configs/emacs/` this is a symlinked address, and init.el is loading .el files in different files. You may refer to `~/project/configs/emacs/config/` to see all the file
